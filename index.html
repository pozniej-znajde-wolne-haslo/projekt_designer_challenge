      </h2>
      <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.

          It has to be a problem that’s personally affecting or affected you, like finding your keys, calling a taxi or even remembering something. Open your eyes, look around you carefully and pay close attention to your surroundings.
